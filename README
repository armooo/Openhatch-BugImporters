This is a collection of code that can import data about
bugs from around the web. It was designed for use within
the OpenHatch website at http://openhatch.org/ but you can
use it too!

Some quick points:

* These bug importers all use Twisted to do asynchronous I/O on the network

* The information we extract is currently the set that is needed for the OpenHatch
  site. If you need more, you are quite welcome to improve this code and submit a
  patch to download even more data from these bug trackers.
